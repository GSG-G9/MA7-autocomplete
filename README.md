### Purpose

This Website is a word autocomplete app - it has access on a big file of words

### Why?
Learning how to build full-stack single-page apps can be laborious when the example app isn't particularly interesing/engaging, HK is an ultra-simple app that will teach you full-stack test-driven-development using (only) core node.js modules on the backend and basic Js on the front-end (no fancy frameworks).

### What you will find here :-

#### Main Page

Here You will find an input field,you can type any word and have an autocomplete for it- it'll search in many english words.
You can click over the result to autocomplete your word.

### How We Do this :-
We divieds the project in to stages :
- Fornt end : 
   - pages : contiant html pages (index) .
- Back end : 
   - routing : serve these end points (/search , / , /any!).

### User story

As a Customer I want to see all the word similer to what i wrote 

> I want to visit your site and immediately see an input filed

As a Customer I want to type a word and then i want to choose the result and search again


### Stretch Goals :-

1. Making more css animation to be more professional.
2. Making the autocomplete work in every word in the field
3. creating a history for the search
4. make another api call for the result.
5. using some advance methods to optimize requests based on time like debounce function .
